# MIMIC-III-Clinical-NLP
 An advanced NLP pipeline leveraging spaCy, SciSpacy, MedSpacy, and ClinicalBERT to extract clinically relevant entities from MIMIC-III ICU notes, with a focus on stroke (ICD-9: 430, 431, 434.x) and other high-impact conditions. It employs medical-specific text normalization, syntactic dependency parsing, and custom word embeddings (Word2Vec, BioWordVec, ClinicalBERT) to enhance entity recognition and semantic analysis. The project integrates t-SNE clustering, frequency distributions, and dependency visualization to uncover patterns in disease progression, treatment pathways, and patient stratification within critical care settings.
